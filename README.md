# Train Scheduler

### Overview

The objective of this assignment was to create an application incorporating Firebase that monitors the arrival and departure data of trains. Utilizing Moment.js, data is manipulated and retrieved. The website is dynamic, providing up-to-date schedules of trains, their arrival times, including how many minutes remain until any train arrives at its station.

### Requirements

* App must meet these specifications:
  * When adding a train, the administrator should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * Calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
  * Users from different machines must be able to view the same train times.

### Added Functionality

* Google sign-in authentication (Credit: https://github.com/alexrosenkranz)
